# Runner Plugin

A powerful code runner plugin for Acode that adds a **play button** to execute different programming languages with just a click! Built using Acode's builtin terminal API so you don't need termux.

> [!Important]
> Ensure Acode's built-in terminal is configured(setup) before using this plugin, otherwise the run button will not appear.
> To enable: open Acode → Menu(three dots) → Terminal, then it will start installation if not installed. Restart Acode if the run button doesn't show after that.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 One-Click Execution** - Simply click the play button to run your code
- **💾 Smart File Handling** - Runs unsaved files, remote files, and files from terminal home
